## Blackjack Project
Project for Skill Distillery Full Stack Java bootcamp
## Overview
This program moves my programming domain to the web with inclusion of several new technologies. This MAMP stack is fused in order to make a Film Query Application in Java which scans a MySQL on a local Apache server for film information. Current functions allow for search for film by ID, and search for film by keyword. Both allow for a more detailed description of a film when requested. Additionally, the find film by keyword function returns all films that contain the input keyword. This function prints film information, filtered asciibetically, sequentially and has options for further description or cancel which returns the user to the main menu. The program will continue until told to quit.
Obligatory: All films, actors, and address's in this project are fictional. Any unintentional relation to non-fictional instances of these is purely coincidental. If you are looking for film, character or street names of high caliber without the high caliber prices then this program is for you!
## Technologies Used
* Development - Java
* IDE - Eclipse
* Text Editor - Atom
* Distributed Version Control - Git/ Github
* Peer Communication - Slack
* Web Server - Apache
* DBMS - MySQL
* MySQL Workbench
* MAMP
* Maven
* XML
* JUnit5
* Caffeine...lots of caffeine

## Unique Challenges
* Integrating DBMS - Web Server - Java Code
* Connection > Prepared Statement > Result Set

## Lessons Learned
* how to break a enhanced for loop
* Tons of procedural knowledge on MySQL, MAMP, MySQLWB, Apache
* MYSQL commands, and structure

## Areas of Improvement
* Did not get around to implementing JUnit5 testing
